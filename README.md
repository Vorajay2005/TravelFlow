### Adding New Pages

   <link href="css/newpage.css" rel="stylesheet" />
   ```
3. Use the existing CSS variables and utility classes for consistency

### How to Link CSS Files

For each page, include the main CSS file plus the page-specific CSS:

```html
<!-- Always include main.css first -->
<link href="css/main.css" rel="stylesheet" />

<!-- Then include page-specific CSS -->
<!-- For homepage -->
<link href="css/homepage.css" rel="stylesheet" />

<!-- For destinations page -->
<link href="css/destinations.css" rel="stylesheet" />

<!-- For packages page -->
<link href="css/packages.css" rel="stylesheet" />

<!-- For testimonials page -->
