  --dark-color: #333; /* Dark Gray */
}
```

### Adding New Pages

1. Create a new HTML file (e.g., `newpage.html`)
2. Add the embedded `<style>` section in the `<head>`:

   ```html
   <head>
     <!-- External CSS libraries -->
     <link
       href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
       rel="stylesheet"
     />
     <link
       href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css"
       rel="stylesheet"
     />

     <!-- Embedded styles -->
     <style>
       /* Your page-specific styles here */
     </style>
   </head>
   ```

3. Use the existing CSS variables and design patterns for consistency

### Styling Structure

Each HTML file contains its styles in embedded `<style>` tags:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- External libraries -->
    <link
      href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootstrap/5.3.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />
    <link
      href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />

    <!-- Page-specific embedded styles -->
    <style>
      /* CSS variables */
      :root {
        /* color definitions */
      }

      /* Page-specific styles */
      /* ... */
    </style>
